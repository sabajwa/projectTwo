(A Random Walk Down Wall Street) is invaluable reading for those who are trying to get a handle on their first 401(k)s.

He emphasizes long-term investments rather than get-rich-quick schemes, and how to predict prices and avoid common mistakes. This is a revised edition of a book that’s been around for a while.

      "We do not know if (Little) is an excellent name for a 208-page book, but this is incontestably a classic primer full of solid advice. The premise is simple: The way you make money in the stock market is by looking for good businesses or products that are priced below what they are worth. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but thankfully Joel Greenblatt has distilled this abstract idea into an easy to follow formula — it is so easy that even those who are not great at math will be able to understand and apply it. In addition to the formula, the book gives you time-tested philosophies of investing, why the stock market usually beats individual investors who try to game the system, and why this formula has the ability to stand the test of time. The Little Book That Beats The Market will help you put together a long-term strategy to ride the wave of ups and downs in the stock market.",

Of course, overnight success is very rare even if you are a brilliant investor, but this book is a case study on a time where it happened. The craziest part? These people became millionaires because of a bet. Dennis’ placed a classified ad after a bet with his professional partner and found people from all walks of life to train for two weeks — and gave them a million dollars to invest. At the end of two weeks, the turtles netted Dennis a cool $100 million. The (investors) were everyone from professional card players to musicians and game designers. In this book, they will tell you what the whole process is like: what the interviews were, what they learned from the master, and how you can apply the rules as well.",

Is it inborn knowledge? Is it inherited money — or luck? It turns out, it’s a combination of a lot of things (no shocker there), but all successful big-time investors have a solid foundation of knowledge and theory, a solid grasp of an investment strategy, and a great attitude. In this book, you will get to hear about it in the words of these investors themselves, and the insight on how to apply them if you are not a mega-millionaire yourself. Mark Wizards laid out in different helpful sections covering futures, equities, economy-wide trends and psychological analysis. It is more of an inspiring read instead of a step-by-step (How To) book.",
